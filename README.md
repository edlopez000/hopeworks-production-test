# Hopeworks-Production-Test

## Description
Assigned a project in which I was to bring an old business webpage up to date. That site is the now defunct: [unleashedmedia.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20021023045302/http://www.unleashedmedia.com:80/)

The original website is from 2002 and a stipulation was to use some of the old assets. Unfortunately, the older assets were created for web 1.0 internet speeds and CRT monitors. I took the mandatory assets and ran them through an image upscaler that uses neural networks to accomplish the task. In the end, they looked serviceable for the assignment.
